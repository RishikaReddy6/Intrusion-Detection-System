# Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on enhancing **network security** by implementing an **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**. The IDS analyzes network traffic and detects potential threats, such as:
- Unauthorized access
- Denial of Service (DoS) attacks
- Malware activities

By leveraging **Machine Learning**, the system classifies network activity as **normal** or **malicious**, helping cybersecurity professionals monitor and prevent cyber threats.

---

## 🚀 Features
- 📊 **Network Traffic Analysis**: Processes the KDD Cup 99 dataset for intrusion detection.
- 🧠 **Machine Learning Models**: Uses classification algorithms to detect threats.
- 📈 **Data Visualization**: Insights into network anomalies.
- 🔍 **Feature Engineering**: Extracts meaningful patterns from network data.
- 🔔 **Scalability**: Can be extended with Deep Learning models, real-time monitoring, and automated alerts.

---

## 📂 Dataset
We use the **KDD Cup 99** or **NSL-KDD** dataset, which contains labeled network traffic data, including both normal and malicious activities.

---

## 🔧 Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

Required Libraries:
- **Python** (for scripting)
- **Pandas & NumPy** (for data handling)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for visualization)
- **Scikit-learn** (for ML model training)

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- **Deep Learning Models** (LSTMs, CNNs) for better accuracy.
- **Real-time Monitoring** for live network security.
- **Automated Alerts** for immediate threat detection.
